# <p align="center"> <ins>Matplotlib Pymaceuticals Challenge</ins>

  What good is data without a good plot to tell the story? <br> In this assignment, I have applied what I have learned about Matplotlib to a real-world situation and dataset.
## <ins>About the challenge</ins>
  
  Assuming I am a senior data analyst who has just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medication, was  given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. The company recently began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer,  In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team had tasked me with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked me for a top-level summary of the study results.
  
  The scripts will calculate and analyse the following:

* It will prepare the data.

* Generate summary statistics.

* Create bar charts and pie charts.

* Calculate quartiles, where it will find outliers, and create a box plot.

* Create a line plot and a scatter plot.

* Calculate correlation and regression.
